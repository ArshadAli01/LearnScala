# 🚀 Scala Learning Journey

Welcome to my **Scala Learning Journey Repository** — a collection of everything I’m learning about Scala, day by day.  
This repository supports my **#LearningInPublic** challenge on [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/arshadali) where I post daily insights about Scala, its concepts, and real-world applications.

## 📘 About This Repository

This repo serves as a **central hub** for:
- 🧠 **Daily Scala Notes** — concise explanations of each topic I learn.  
- 💻 **Code Examples** — practical code snippets and exercises from my learning sessions.  
- 📚 **References & Resources** — links to helpful tutorials, articles, and documentation.  

I aim to make this repo beginner-friendly and helpful for anyone who wants to start with Scala and the JVM ecosystem.
